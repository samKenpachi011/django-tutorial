** Understanding django**

## What is Django

## Why Django

## Django vs Other frameworks

**Covered :**
 * Make sure Python,Django,Django-admin are installed

## Part 1: Creating a Project
**Covered :**
 * Using the django-admin startproject to create a project ->django-admin createproject mysite
 * Django helps create a project with default files and configurations
 * **Understanding what the default files do :**
	* __init__.py --> for python to treat this folder as a package.
	* asgi.py --> Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. It extends the capabilities of WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), which is a standard way of communication between the web server and the web applications in most of the python web frameworks like Django.
	* wsgi.py --> needed when deploying a project over wsgi.
	* urls.py --> used t map out incoming requests to views.
	* settings.py -->where all the project configuration reside.
 * Using the manage.py to do administrative tasks same as django-admin
 * Using manage.py to run the built in django server ->python manage.py runserver
 * Creating an Application (Django comes with a utility that automatically generates the basic directory structure of an app thus saving you time in creating directories)
 * Creating an app ->python manage.py startapp <app-name> eg. python manage.py startapp polls 
 * **Understanding what the default files in an app do :**
	* admin.py --> layout for the admin site/how it is going to look like
	* migrations --> generating database tables
	* apps.py --> configuration for the app
	* models.py --> used to define model classes that communicate with the database
	* tests.py --> writing unit tests
	* views.py --> every data exchange needs to have a request/response thats where views comes in
**Side Note :**
 * Projects vs. apps
 * An app is a Web application that does something â€“ e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects. 

**Writing Views :**
 * A view acts as a middle man between our models and templates they are request handlers
 * When creating views then after they should be mapped to urls
 * **Key variables and functions :**
    * HttpResponse ->
	* render() ->
	* include() ->function allows referencing other URLconfs. 
	* path() ->function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional: kwargs, and name. 
 * Views can be function based or class based
 
## Creating Models: Part2
**What are models and how do they fit into django:**
 * Models provide a single source of truth for our data. Allow us to define schemas  
 * Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.
**Side Note :**
 * Knowing about the ORM-Object Relational Mapper
 * ORM is a powerful technique in django even though it has its pitfalls. It gives us a level of abstraction which makes it easy to work with object.
 * ORM ->Let's us query and manipulate data from a database using an object oriented paradigm thus the developer does not have to write any SQL.
 * Link [ORM-Brief](https://data-flair.training/blogs/django-orm-tutorial/ https://data-flair.training/blogs/django-orm-tutorial/)
**Getting Back to Models ðŸ˜ƒ :**
 * Each model is a python class that subclasses from django.db.models.Model 
 * The Model class has helper functions (Fields,Autofields)
 * Once you have defined your models, you need to tell Django youâ€™re going to use those models. Do this by editing your settings file and changing the INSTALLED_APPS setting to add the name of the module that contains your models.py.
 * Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - theyâ€™re files on disk. 
 * save()->
**Side Note :**
 * Migrations ->Letting django know about changes in the model
 * Migrate  ->Applying migrations to the database
 * Using the interactive shell to interact with the database API
 * using double underscore functions __str__()
 * filter,using create,delete()
 
## Djangon Admin 
**Note :**
 * Link [DjangoAdmin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/admin/)
 * In web development sites need to have an admin side for your staff or clients to add, change, and delete content .
 * Django entirely automates creation of admin interfaces for models include forms which by default take up the html representation of the datafields for which they have been defined.
 * Users are created using the __*createsuperuser*__ command
 * To display models on the admin site we have to register them in the admin.py
 * The register function is used to add models to the Django admin so that data for those models can be created, deleted, updated and queried through the user interface.
 * syntax -> __*admin.site.register(<ModelName>)*__
**Side Note :**
 * The ModelAdmin class is the representation of a model in the admin interface 
 * One can register multiple models using the register decoration
 * ** The ModelAdmin is very flexible. It has several options for dealing with customizing the interface :**
    * date_hierarchy 
	* fields
	* exclude
	* empty_value_display
	* fieldsets
	* filter_horizontal
	* filter_vertical
	* form
	* formfield_overrides
	* list_display
	* list_editable
	* list_filter 
	* radio_fields
 * There are also custom template options to override or extend the default admin templates	
 * ** InlineModelAdmin objects :**
    * This class allows us to edit a model on the same page as a parent model.
	* InlineModelAdmin shares many of the same features as ModelAdmin, and adds some of its own (the shared features are actually defined in the BaseModelAdmin superclas
	* There are 2 subclasses: TabularInline, StackedInline
 * Overriding admin templates
 * Some changes need for a AdminSite instance to be created.
 * A Django administrative site is represented by an instance of django.contrib.admin.sites.AdminSite; by default, an instance of this class is created as django.contrib.admin.site and you can register your models and ModelAdmin instances with it.
 * ** Not every template in contrib/admin/templates/admin may be overridden per app or per model.**
